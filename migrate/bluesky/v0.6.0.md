## The return value of `createRecord` and `updateRecord` has been modified to `StrongRef`

See [atproto v0.4.0](https://github.com/myConsciousness/atproto.dart/blob/main/migrate/atproto/v0.4.0.md) for details of this fix.

The return type of `createRecord` and `updateRecord` of `RepositoriesService` in the `atproto` package
has been changed from `Record` to `StrongRef`, and the following methods have been similarly modified.

| Service       | Method          |
| ------------- | --------------- |
| ActorsService | updateProfile   |
| FeedsService  | createPost      |
| FeedsService  | createThread    |
| FeedsService  | createRepost    |
| FeedsService  | createLike      |
| FeedsService  | createGenerator |
| GraphsService | createFollow    |
| GraphsService | createBlock     |
| GraphsService | createList      |
| GraphsService | createListItem  |

## The `BlobContext` and `LegacyBlob` objects have been removed

See [atproto v0.4.0](https://github.com/myConsciousness/atproto.dart/blob/main/migrate/atproto/v0.4.0.md) for details of this fix.

The removal of `BlobContext` and `LegacyBlob` in the `atproto` package has been followed by a similar fix in the `bluesky` package.

Until now, when getting a Blob from the following object, `.when(...)` from `BlobContext` of type Union.
But now you can get the `Blob` object directly from this version.

- `Image`
- `EmbedExternalThumbnail`
