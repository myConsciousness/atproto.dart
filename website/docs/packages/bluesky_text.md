# bluesky_text [![pub package](https://img.shields.io/pub/v/bluesky_text.svg?logo=dart&logoColor=00b9fc)](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/bluesky_text) [![Dart SDK Version](https://badgen.net/pub/sdk-version/bluesky_text)](https://pub.dev/packages/bluesky_text/)

**[bluesky_text](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/bluesky_text)** is a package that elegantly resolves `RichText` called `Facet` in Bluesky API.

This package automatically extracts basic entities from text, such as `handles (@)` and `links (http|https)`, and generates facets that conform to the Bluesky API specification.

In addition, `hashtags (#)` and `cashtags ($)`, which are not implemented in Bluesky Social, can be extracted as **Custom Entity** with any regular expression of the user's choice.
This feature allows you to implement a post function specific to your app.

In **[bluesky_text](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/bluesky_text)**, text elements are counted as **Unicode Grapheme Clusters**.
In other words, multibyte characters includes emojis are also counted as a single character.

## Getting Started 💪

### Install

:::tip
See the **[Install Package](../getting_started/install_package.md)** section for more details on how to install a package in your [Dart](https://dart.dev) and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) app.
:::

**With Dart:**

```bash
dart pub add bluesky_text
```

```bash
dart pub get
```

**With Flutter:**

```bash
flutter pub add bluesky_text
```

```bash
flutter pub get
```

### Import

Just by writing following one-line import, you can use all the features provided by **[bluesky_text](https://pub.dev/packages/bluesky_text)**.

```dart
import 'package:bluesky_text/bluesky_text.dart';
```

### Instantiate **BlueskyText**

All you have to do with the **[bluesky_text](https://pub.dev/packages/bluesky_text)** is pass any text to the **[BlueskyText](https://pub.dev/documentation/bluesky_text/latest/bluesky_text/BlueskyText-class.html)** object.

```dart
import 'package:bluesky_text/bluesky_text.dart';

void main() {
  // You just need to pass text to parse.
  final text = BlueskyText(
    'I speak 日本語 and English 🚀 @shinyakato.dev and @shinyakato.bsky.social. '
    'Visit 🚀 https://shinyakato.dev.',
  );

  print(text.value); // String equivalent to the string passed to BlueskyText.
}
```

### Extract **Entities**

The entities in the text passed to `BlueskyText` in the [above example](#instantiate-blueskytext) are as follows.

- **Handles**
  - `@shinyakato.dev`
  - `@shinyakato.bsky.social`
- **Links**
  - `https://shinyakato.dev`

To extract all of these entities, call the `entities` property as follows.

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:bluesky_text/bluesky_text.dart';

void main() {
  // You just need to pass text to parse.
  final text = BlueskyText(
    'I speak 日本語 and English 🚀 @shinyakato.dev and @shinyakato.bsky.social. '
    'Visit 🚀 https://shinyakato.dev.',
  );

  // Extract all entities.
  final entities = text.entities;

  // Convert entities to JSON representation.
  print(entities.map((e) => jsonEncode(e.toJson())).toList());
}
```

Then you will then get the following result, which includes all the entities just listed.
The response is formatted as JSON to make the structure of the response easier to understand.

```json
[
  {
    "type": "handle",
    "value": "@shinyakato.dev",
    "indices": { "start": 35, "end": 50 }
  },
  {
    "type": "handle",
    "value": "@shinyakato.bsky.social",
    "indices": { "start": 55, "end": 78 }
  },
  {
    "type": "link",
    "value": "https://shinyakato.dev",
    "indices": { "start": 91, "end": 113 }
  }
]
```

As shown above, for each type of entity, you can correctly obtain the entity and the **Indices** of the location where the entity appears.
This **Indices** is the position of occurrence expressed in bytes.

:::tip
If you want to extract **only Handles**, you can use the `handles` property. And if you want to extract **only Links**, you can use the `links` property.

```dart
import 'package:bluesky_text/bluesky_text.dart';

void main() {
  // You just need to pass text to parse.
  final text = BlueskyText(
    'I speak 日本語 and English 🚀 @shinyakato.dev and @shinyakato.bsky.social. '
    'Visit 🚀 https://shinyakato.dev.',
  );

  print(text.handles); // Only handles.
  print(text.links); // Only links.
}
```

And check following table.

| Method       | Description                                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **handles**  | Extracts all handles and byte string unit Indices in the text.           |
| **links**    | Extracts all links and byte string unit Indices in the text.             |
| **entities** | Extracts all handles and links and byte string unit Indices in the text. |
:::

:::caution
The current specification defines **_300 characters_** as the maximum number of characters for **[bluesky_text](https://pub.dartlang.org/packages/bluesky_text)**, which is the text limit defined in the Lexicon of **[app.bsky.feed.post](https://github.com/bluesky-social/atproto/blob/main/lexicons/app/bsky/feed/post.json)**.
And `StateError` will be thrown whenever you run a method that extracts entities for text that exceeds the maximum number of characters.
This means that you must check to see if the text you pass to the `BlueskyText` object exceeds the maximum number of characters and **[Split Text](#split-text)** if necessary.

You can check if the string passed to the `BlueskyText` object exceeds the maximum number of characters with `isLengthLimitExceeded` or `isNotLengthLimitExceeded` as follows.

```dart
import 'package:bluesky_text/bluesky_text.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final text = BlueskyText(
    'I speak 日本語 and English 🚀 @shinyakato.dev and @shinyakato.bsky.social. '
    'Visit 🚀 https://shinyakato.dev.',
  );

  print(text.isLengthLimitExceeded);
  print(text.isNotLengthLimitExceeded);
}
```
:::

### Generate **Facets**

To generate **Facets** that can be used with the Bluesky API using the [extracted collection of facets](#extract-entities), use `toFacets` method as follows.

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:bluesky_text/bluesky_text.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  // You just need to pass text to parse.
  final text = BlueskyText(
    'I speak 日本語 and English 🚀 @shinyakato.dev and @shinyakato.bsky.social. '
    'Visit 🚀 https://shinyakato.dev.',
  );

  final entities = text.entities;

  // Convert entities to collection of facets.
  final facets = await entities.toFacets();

  // Convert to JSON representation.
  print(jsonEncode(facets));
}
```

The `toFacets` method involves asynchronous processing to resolve user handles as DIDs, so add the `Future` and `async` modifiers to the calling method.
Then specify `await` when calling the `toFacets` method. If the Entity's collection contains only links, it will also be processed asynchronously.

Executing the above example, you will get a JSON object converted to a Bluesky API compliant facets structure, as shown below.
In the following example, the response is converted to JSON to make the structure of the response easier to understand.

```json
[
  {
    "index": { "byteStart": 35, "byteEnd": 50 },
    "features": [
      {
        "$type": "app.bsky.richtext.facet#mention",
        "did": "did:plc:iijrtk7ocored6zuziwmqq3c"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "index": { "byteStart": 55, "byteEnd": 78 },
    "features": [
      {
        "$type": "app.bsky.richtext.facet#mention",
        "did": "did:plc:wpyvghtrmnflwxmknbz67vct"
      }
    ]
  },
  {
    "index": { "byteStart": 91, "byteEnd": 113 },
    "features": [
      {
        "$type": "app.bsky.richtext.facet#link",
        "uri": "https://shinyakato.dev"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

## More Tips 🏄

### Unicode Grapheme Clusters

Text in Bluesky is counted as **Unicode Grapheme Clusters**.
So, even multibyte characters such as Japanese and emoji are counted as one character.

**[bluesky_text](https://pub.dev/packages/bluesky_text)** also counts characters in Grapheme Cluster units.
The count of characters related to the text interpreted by **[bluesky_text](https://pub.dev/packages/bluesky_text)** can be obtained with the `.length` property as follows.

```dart
import 'package:bluesky_text/bluesky_text.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final text = BlueskyText(
    'I speak 日本語 and English 🚀 @shinyakato.dev and @shinyakato.bsky.social. '
    'Visit 🚀 https://shinyakato.dev.',
  );

  // Japanese and emojis are counted as one character.
  print(text.length);
}
```

### Use with [bluesky](./bluesky.md)

**Facet** generated by **[bluesky_text](https://pub.dev/packages/bluesky_text)** can be easily integrated into the **[bluesky](https://pub.dev/packages/bluesky)** package.
There are several endpoints that use Facet in the Bluesky API, but we will use the endpoint that creates a post as an example.

:::info
The **[bluesky](https://pub.dev/packages/bluesky)** package is a powerful wrapper library that supports the AT Protocol and Bluesky APIs. You can see more details [here](./bluesky.md).
:::

You can integrate **[bluesky_text](https://pub.dev/packages/bluesky_text)** and **[bluesky](https://pub.dev/packages/bluesky)** as follows.

```dart
import 'package:bluesky/bluesky.dart' as bsky;
import 'package:bluesky_text/bluesky_text.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final text = BlueskyText(
    'I speak 日本語 and English 🚀 @shinyakato.dev and @shinyakato.bsky.social. '
    'Visit 🚀 https://shinyakato.dev.',
  );

  // Bluesky object.
  final bluesky = bsky.Bluesky.fromSession(await _session);
  // Convert entities to facets representation.
  final facets = await text.entities.toFacets();

  await bluesky.feeds.createPost(
    text: text.value,

    // Convert JSON to Facet object like this.
    facets: facets.map(bsky.Facet.fromJson).toList(),
  );
}
```

You see that there is nothing difficult to implement here.
Extracting and faceting entities using **[bluesky_text](https://pub.dev/packages/bluesky_text)** is implemented as described in [Getting Started](#getting-started-).

And the `bluesky.feeds.createPost` used as an example is a fairly basic method for creating a post using the **[bluesky](https://pub.dev/packages/bluesky)** package.
But, this is where **[bluesky_text](https://pub.dev/packages/bluesky_text)** is most powerful, as it can be converted into a `Facet` object in the **[bluesky](https://pub.dev/packages/bluesky)** package without any difficult processing.
With **[bluesky_text](https://pub.dev/packages/bluesky_text)**, you can create Facets that are difficult to structure when creating a post using the Bluesky API without having to think about it.

### Split Text

As mentioned in the section describing [entity extraction](#extract-entities), the `BlueskyText` object has a maximum number of characters for text, and any operation on text that exceeds that maximum will always throw a `StateError`.
This is because the maximum number of characters allowed for each text in the Bluesky API is clearly defined, and any operation on a text that exceeds the maximum number of characters is meaningless.

So do you always need to be aware of the number of characters of text you pass to the `BlueskyText` object in units of Grapheme Cluster? **No, you don't need it**. Instead, just call `.split()` as follows.
You can also use `isLengthLimitExceeded` or `isNotLengthLimitExceeded` to determine if the text exceeds the maximum number of characters.

```dart
import 'package:bluesky_text/bluesky_text.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final text = BlueskyText('a' * 301);

  // Whether the maximum number of characters is exceeded.
  if (text.isLengthLimitExceeded) {
    // Split based on the maximum number of characters.
    // Returns new collection of BlueskyText.
    final texts = text.split();

    for (final _text in texts) {
      print(_text.entities);
    }
  }
}
```

### Custom Entity

**[bluesky_text](https://pub.dev/packages/bluesky_text)** basically parses handles and http-based links officially supported by Bluesky, but it can be customized by implementors to parse any entity.
This is a feature called `Custom Entity` in **[bluesky_text](https://pub.dev/packages/bluesky_text)**. `Custom Entity` can be used to extract hashtags or cashtags from text that are not supported by Bluesky, for example.

Let's assume the following situation where a hashtag is included in the text.

```txt title="Text with Hashtag"
This is my #hashtag.
```

You can extract a hashtag as follows.

```dart
import 'package:bluesky_text/bluesky_text.dart';

void main() {
  final text = BlueskyText('This is my #hashtag.');

  // Extract custom entity.
  final entities = text.getCustomEntities([
    EntityCriterion(
      symbols: ['#'], // Specify entity marks.
      format: RegExp(r'#(\w+)'), // Specify exact formatting with regex.
    )
  ]);

  print(entities);
}
```

As you see, `.getCustomEntities` is the method for parsing `Custom Entity`. `.getCustomEntities` can extract any user-defined token, not just handle and link.

The point to using `.getCustomEntities` is an object called `EntityCriterion` that represents the criteria for the entity to be parsed.
The `EntityCriterion` has a **prefix or other symbol to search for entities** to analyze, and a **regular expression to represent the format of the entity** for more accurate entity analysis.

:::caution
The regular expression parameter is **_optional_**, but is recommended if you want to be sure to extract specific entities.
If the regular expression parameter is omitted, the entity is searched based only on the string specified in `symbols`.
:::

Then, the object returned from `.getCustomEntities` is `CustomEntities`. To generate `Facets` from `CustomEntities`, implement as follows.

```dart
import 'dart:convert';

import 'package:bluesky_text/bluesky_text.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final text = BlueskyText('This is my #hashtag.');

  final entities = text.getCustomEntities([
    EntityCriterion(
      symbols: ['#'],
      format: RegExp(r'#(\w+)'),
    )
  ]);

  // Call `.toFacets`.
  final facets = await entities.toFacets(
    // Define custom features.
    (entity) => CustomFeature(
      type: 'dev.shinyakato.something.hashtag', // Unique namespace is recommended.
      builder: (value) => {
        'hashtag': value, // It will be a feature value.
      },
    ),
  );

  // Convert to JSON representation.
  print(jsonEncode(facets));
}
```

Unlike the `.toFacets` method as seen in [Getting Started](#generate-facets), this one is a bit more advanced in implementation.
To generate `Facets` from a `CustomEntities` object, you must define the structure of the Facet you wish to generate using a callback.
This is because `CustomEntities` and `CustomEntity` objects do not know about the `Facets` they generate.

First, you need to return a `CustomFeature` object as a callback to the `.toFacets` method.
The `type` field of the `CustomFeature` object should be a namespace that represents your extracted entity.

:::danger
The namespace specified for `type` should be a unique value that does not duplicate the official Lexicon ID.
If you specify a `type` in a way that duplicates an official Lexicon ID, your registered data may become noise when that ID you specified is actually implemented even officially.
:::

Then, in the `builder` of the `CustomFeature`, return the JSON you wish to specify as the Facet's Feature based on the `value` of the entity passed in the callback.

Now, if we run the above example, we get the following results.
The result of this process is converted as JSON to better understand the structure.

```json
[
  {
    "index": { "byteStart": 11, "byteEnd": 19 },
    "features": [
      { "hashtag": "#hashtag", "$type": "dev.shinyakato.something.hashtag" }
    ]
  }
]
```
