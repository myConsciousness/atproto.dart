# Install Dart/Flutter

**[atproto.dart](https://github.com/myConsciousness/atproto.dart)** is built in the **[Dart](https://dart.dev)**. The packages provided by **[atproto.dart](https://github.com/myConsciousness/atproto.dart)** can then be incorporated into [Flutter](https://flutter.dev) apps.

So, to use **[atproto.dart](https://github.com/myConsciousness/atproto.dart)** packages, you need to have **[Dart](https://dart.dev)** and **[Flutter](https://flutter.dev)** installed on your machine anyway.

## What Is Dart/Flutter?

Dart is **developed by Google** and is an **object-oriented language** with a syntax very **similar to C and Java**. Dart also has a lot of **modern syntax that is very similar to TypeScript**, due to the way it has been developed as AltJS. And **100% Null Safety** is now guaranteed with [Dart3](https://medium.com/p/53f065a10635).

And Dart has recently begun to attract attention because of the release of the **Flutter** framework. Flutter is a **cross-platform framework** that uses Dart to write programs. With Flutter, you can develop apps that run on Android OS and iOS at once **by simply building a single code written in Dart**, and recently web and desktop apps are also supported.

So, Dart and Flutter are highly touted as languages and frameworks that can dramatically improve development productivity. By combining Dart or Flutter with the packages from **[atproto.dart](https://github.com/myConsciousness/atproto.dart)**, you will be able to very productively develop AT Protocol and Bluesky related apps.

By the way, this is **_Dash_**. This is the mascot for the Dart language and the Flutter framework.

## Let's Install Dart/Flutter ðŸŽ¯

Dart and Flutter can be installed very easily using [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/flutter).

Simply run the following command on the terminal to install the latest versions of Dart and Flutter on your machine.

```bash
brew install --cask flutter
```

This installation will take a bit of time, but enjoy feeling like a hacker for a while. Once the installation is complete, let's make sure that Dart and Flutter are indeed active on your machine!

Run `flutter --version` like:

```bash
flutter --version
```

And the installation was successful if the Dart and Flutter version is output like:

```bash
Flutter 3.10.5 â€¢ channel stable â€¢ https://github.com/flutter/flutter.git
Framework â€¢ revision 796c8ef792 (4 days ago) â€¢ 2023-06-13 15:51:02 -0700
Engine â€¢ revision 45f6e00911
Tools â€¢ Dart 3.0.5 â€¢ DevTools 2.23.1
```

You can now develop Dart and Flutter apps on your machine. And of course, **[atproto.dart](https://github.com/myConsciousness/atproto.dart)** packages are also available!

If you would like to learn more about developing apps with Dart and Flutter, please refer to the following official documentation.
