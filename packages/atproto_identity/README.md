# AT Protocol Identity for Dart

`atproto_identity` resolves AT Protocol identities and verifies inbound
service-auth JWTs. It is a small, dependency-light building block: no code
generation, and it depends only on [`http`](https://pub.dev/packages/http) and
[`did_plc`](https://pub.dev/packages/did_plc).

Use it to:

- **Resolve** a handle or DID to its DID, PDS origin, and `#atproto` signing key.
- **Verify** an inbound AppView service-auth JWT (e.g. in a custom feed
  generator or other AppView) and recover the viewer's DID.

## Installation

```yaml
dependencies:
  atproto_identity: ^0.1.0 # Replace with the actual version
```

## Resolving an identity

`HttpIdentityResolver` accepts a handle (`alice.example`, optionally prefixed
with `@` or `at://`) or a DID (`did:plc:` / `did:web:`):

```dart
import 'package:atproto_identity/atproto_identity.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final resolver = HttpIdentityResolver();

  final identity = await resolver.resolve('shinyakato.dev');

  print(identity.did); // did:plc:...
  print(identity.pds); // https://... (origin, no trailing slash)
  print(identity.handle); // shinyakato.dev
  print(identity.signingKey); // #atproto publicKeyMultibase, or null
}
```

When resolution starts from a handle, the resolver verifies the DID document
claims that handle back through `alsoKnownAs` (bidirectional handle
verification). On any failure it throws an `IdentityException`.

`HttpIdentityResolver` is configurable and injectable:

```dart
final resolver = HttpIdentityResolver(
  handleResolver: 'https://public.api.bsky.app',
  plcDirectory: 'https://plc.directory',
  httpClient: myHttpClient, // optional package:http Client
);
```

`IdentityResolver` is an interface, so you can supply your own (cached, offline,
test-double) implementation anywhere this package expects one.

## Verifying an inbound service-auth JWT

`verifyServiceAuth` verifies an inbound AppView service-auth JWT taken from an
`Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` header and returns the issuer (viewer) DID:

```dart
import 'package:atproto_identity/atproto_identity.dart';

Future<String> authenticate(String authorizationHeader) async {
  return verifyServiceAuth(
    authorizationHeader,
    serviceDid: 'did:web:feed.example.com', // this service's DID; must equal `aud`
    resolver: HttpIdentityResolver(),
    expectedLxm: 'app.bsky.feed.getFeedSkeleton', // optional; must equal `lxm`
  );
}
```

It validates the JOSE header, the token's `aud`, `exp`, `iat`, `nbf`, optional
`lxm`, and `iss` claims, resolves the issuer's `#atproto` signing key, and checks
the signature (ES256K / P-256) via `did_plc`. It **fails closed**:

- the `alg` header must be `ES256K` or `ES256`, rejecting `none`, HMAC, and RSA
  (the signing curve is still pinned from the DID document — this is defense in
  depth), and `typ`, when present, must be a JWT media type;
- the signature must be a 64-byte compact ECDSA signature;
- an out-of-range `exp` is rejected up front instead of overflowing;
- the token lifetime is bounded by `maxTokenLifetime` (default 60 minutes; pass
  `null` to opt out), and `iat` (not in the future) / `nbf` (not-before) are
  enforced when present, with a 30-second clock-skew allowance.

Any failure — malformed header/JWT, an untrusted `alg`, wrong audience,
expired/not-yet-valid token, an `exp` beyond `maxTokenLifetime`, `lxm` mismatch,
unresolvable issuer, missing signing key, or a signature that does not verify —
throws an `IdentityException`.
