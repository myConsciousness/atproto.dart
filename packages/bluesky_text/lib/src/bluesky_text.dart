/// This class provides high-performance analysis of [Bluesky Social](https://blueskyweb.xyz)'s text
/// and features related to secure posting.
///
/// By using the analysis feature of this class,
/// you can get the values of all the following entities contained in the text
/// and the Indices that can be used as is when posting using the Bluesky API.
///
/// The value of this Indices is counted based on the number of byte characters
/// and can be used as is for `ByteSlice` in the `facets` parameter of
/// `app.bsky.feed.post` in the Bluesky API.
///
/// It supports analysis of the following entities.
///
/// - **Handle** (like @shinyakato.dev)
/// - **Link** (like https://shinyakato.dev)
/// - **Tag** (like #hashtag)
///
/// The class also supports counting the number of characters using `grapheme`,
/// and the length of the string that can be obtained with [length] is
/// the one counted using grapheme. In other words, as per Bluesky Social's
/// official specifications, **an emoji is counted as one character**.
///
/// ## How To Use
///
/// You simply pass any text to the [BlueskyText] object to create an instance
/// like following.
///
/// ```dart
/// final text = BlueskyText(
///   'I speak æ—¥æœ¬èªž and English ðŸš€ @shinyakato.dev and @shinyakato.bsky.social. '
///   'Visit ðŸš€ https://shinyakato.dev.',
/// );
/// ```
///
/// The length of the string passed to [BlueskyText] can be longer than
/// 300 characters in grapheme. But, if there is a possibility that more than
/// 300 characters of text will be passed, be sure to check if the character
/// count is exceeded and split the BlueskyText using the [split] method as
/// follows.
///
/// ```dart
/// final text = BlueskyText(
///   'I speak æ—¥æœ¬èªž and English ðŸš€ @shinyakato.dev and @shinyakato.bsky.social. '
///   'Visit ðŸš€ https://shinyakato.dev.',
/// );
///
/// if (text.isLengthLimitExceeded) {
///   final texts = text.split();
///
///   for (final text in texts) {
///     print(text.handles);
///     print(text.links);
///     print(text.entities);
///   }
/// } else {
///   print(text.handles);
///   print(text.links);
///   print(text.entities);
/// }
/// ```

  /// break up text that is longer than 300 characters into appropriate lengths
  /// and then post them in a thread or other format. This method exists for
  /// that purpose.
  ///
  /// Also, this method is very aware of tokens when splitting [value]. This
  /// means that even if you specify a maximum number of characters for
  /// splitting, if some tokens exceed the maximum number of characters in t
  /// he middle, you do not have to worry about them being split at the halfway
